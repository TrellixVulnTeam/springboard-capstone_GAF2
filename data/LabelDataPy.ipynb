    "# Label Data For Summarization\n",
    "This notebook uses data from the [\"cnn_dailymail\" dataset from Tensorflow Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cnn_dailymail).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to simplify the summarization task. Instead of generating abstract summaries, I will instead extract sentences which best summarize the document. To define how to best summarize the document I use the rouge1 score. For this I am using the rouge-scorer python library. \n",
    "\n",
    "To classify the sentences as part of the summary or not, this notebook uses a greedy algorithm. Like described in the paper below. It first looks at the rouge score for each sentence in the document compared with the summary. It selects the one that improves the rouge score the most. Then it tries to find another sentence that further improves this metric. It does this until it has found N or the rouge metric is not improving. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CNN/Daily Mail dataset is split into train/validation/test subsets. This notebook will create `<name>.labeled.parquet` files for each subset. The data comes from Tensorflow Datasets [cnn_dailymail](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cnn_dailymail)\n",
    "\n",
    "This can take a while to run, mainly because of the rouge score optimization. The dataset has around 300 thousand examples which takes about 2 hours to process on a 2019 8 core MacBook Pro. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can also creates data sets for 3 different sentence tokenizers so we can evaluate if there is a better option. They are Spark NLP, Spacy and NLTK. See the `sent_splitters` dict to set which ones you want to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea for labeling like this comes from this paper:\n",
