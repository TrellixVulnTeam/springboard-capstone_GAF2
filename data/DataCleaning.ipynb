       "20  football is the main driver of college sports these days. i do not like that fact as i am not a big cfb fan but i am not stupid enough to deny what is in front of me. i am also one who think the best conferences fit geographically. that being said, these are the ones i think are better and worse from a football standpoint. best any team that moved to a bcs conference and did not miss a beat. i would say atm and nebraska are the only two good moves right now. wvu got exposed for their lack of defense. missouri is in misery. colorado is terrible and utah got exposed for not feasting on mountain west teams year in and year out. worst every team in the big east conference. for multiple reasons. it is the only major conference to lose more than 3 teams to other conferences in the bcs era. it lost 6, 7 if you count tcu which never played a big east down. it has the perception bestowed on it by national media as being undeserving of major conference status despite it is bowl record since 2006 when the new teams came in. the acc has a worse bcs bowl record than the big east and i believe even has a worse bowl record than the big east overall since that time. if it is not worse, it is certainly close. since the big east is being perceived as being weak, the top teams in the big east louisville, cincinnati, rutgers are automatically seen as weak despite that not necessarily being true. yes, i know that mac teams have taken out uc and ru this year. mac teams have also taken out some b1g teams as well, but those teams are not being seen as being weak. boise and sdsu joined up for bcs exposure. in reality neither team should be in a conference based in rhode island and that exposure they wanted through the big east goes away in 2014 when the big east seen as being a weak little sister gets no automatic bid to the premier bowls the sec, b12, b1g, pac 12, and acc which should not be automatically given a seat statistically they do not deserve if the big east does not deserve a seat are getting. houston, smu, memphis, temple, and ucf have the same problem. plus navy is getting in in a few years time, and although it does not matter to them, they will not get any bcs bowl exposure at all. notre dame was in the conference for everything but football but never joined the big east in football. what i find very insulting is that they allegedly agreed to play 3 big east teams but they were typically traditional rivals like pitt, syracuse and then rutgers, uconn or south florida, the latter in 2 year deals. i know usf was a one shot deal but did not and then did not play wvu, uc, or uofl where cincinnati and louisville have significant catholic populations. now notre dame has agreed to play 5 acc teams a year. that seems like a gigantic middle finger to the conference that agreed to take their non football teams out of the mid continent conference to a larger stage for 15 years. the media does not deem the big east relevant and the big east has certainly obliged that decision by not shoring up football after boston college and miami wanted to leave vt i think got thrusted on the acc and added additional basketball schools for whatever reason. truth be told, i want out. i really do not care if the big east would be an easy conference to win. big east decision making essentially damned my school back to the perception of mediocrity in football and we look to always be on the outside looking in. give me the big 12. west virginia will be happy and if our football coach leaves, it will not be because of the glass ceiling being in the big east has not placed on us. basketball we are good anywhere.   \n",
