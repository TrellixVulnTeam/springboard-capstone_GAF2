    "The CNN/Daily Mail dataset seems to be one of the most popular data sets for text summarization problems and is frequently used as a benchmark dataset. The Reddit TL;DR datset also looks attractive due to its size. There is potential to find ways to filter out lower quality summaries to then improve the text summarization problem. "

       "      <td>By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 09:53 EST, 12 January 2012 . A motorist was stunned when he discovered double yellow lines had been painted underneath his car while it was parked - and then given a ticket. Flecks of yellow paint were even sprayed on the bumper of Patrick McCrystal's car as the lines were painted under the front of it in Kedleston Street, Derby. The 49-year-old had parked his Ford Fiesta in the street near to a Co-operative store and a petrol station, where he works, for three years. Stunned: Patrick McCrystal with his Ford Fiesta, which was given a ticket after council workmen had sprayed yellow lines under the car while it was parked legally . When he parked for his 2pm shift, he noticed new yellow lines had been painted across a housing block entrance. But there was a gap between those lines and existing ones in the street, so Mr McCrystal parked there, in his usual spot. Hours later, a colleague on his dinner break saw that extra lines had been painted below the front of Mr McCrystal's car. And, when he went out, Mr McCrystal discovered he had been given a parking ticket. Tell-tale sign: The workmen left flecks of paint on the bumper of the car as they sprayed underneath . He said: 'There is even paint on my front bumper where they've caught it reaching under to paint the lines. 'There were no lines there when I parked. I can't believe they've done it.' The new lines extended from existing double yellow lines which had previously ended about two feet from Mr McCrystal's front bumper. Apology: The ticket left on Mr McCrystal's window. Derby City Council blamed a breakdown in communication and has now revoked the £70 fine . Now a Derby City Council official has said the £70 fine had been issued in error and would be revoked. Mr McCrystal, from Derby, said notices had been put up several weeks ago saying parking restrictions would be introduced but they did not say when. He said: 'If they were going to paint yellow lines then they should have put up cones to stop people parking. 'When I pulled up, I saw the gap between the old lines and the new ones and thought it was okay to park there. Nothing gave me the impression I couldn't.' A passer-by said council staff had been angered they could not paint the lines because of the parked car. David Gartside, head of traffic and transport at the authority, said: 'We can confirm that lining was painted on Kedleston Street this afternoon after the vehicle had parked and that a parking ticket was issued to the vehicle in error. 'It appears that there was a communication breakdown between our contractors undertaking the lining work and our enforcement officers. 'The ticket will be revoked and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.'</td>\n",

Flecks of yellow paint were even sprayed on the bumper of Patrick McCrystal's car as the lines were painted under the front of it in Kedleston Street, Derby. The 49-year-old had parked his Ford Fiesta in the street near to a Co-operative store and a petrol station, where he works, for three years. Stunned: Patrick McCrystal with his Ford Fiesta, which was given a ticket after council workmen had sprayed yellow lines under the car while it was parked legally . When he parked for his 2pm shift, he noticed new yellow lines had been painted across a housing block entrance. But there was a gap between those lines and existing ones in the street, so Mr McCrystal parked there, in his usual spot. Hours later, a colleague on his dinner break saw that extra lines had been painted below the front of Mr McCrystal's car. And, when he went out, Mr McCrystal discovered he had been given a parking ticket. Tell-tale sign: The workmen left flecks of paint on the bumper of the car as they sprayed underneath . He said: 'There is even paint on my front bumper where they've caught it reaching under to paint the lines. 'There were no lines there when I parked. I can't believe they've done it.' The new lines extended from existing double yellow lines which had previously ended about two feet from Mr McCrystal's front bumper. Apology: The ticket left on Mr McCrystal's window. Derby City Council blamed a breakdown in communication and has now revoked the £70 fine . Now a Derby City Council official has said the £70 fine had been issued in error and would be revoked. Mr McCrystal, from Derby, said notices had been put up several weeks ago saying parking restrictions would be introduced but they did not say when. He said: 'If they were going to paint yellow lines then they should have put up cones to stop people parking. 'When I pulled up, I saw the gap between the old lines and the new ones and thought it was okay to park there. Nothing gave me the impression I couldn't.' A passer-by said council staff had been angered they could not paint the lines because of the parked car. David Gartside, head of traffic and transport at the authority, said: 'We can confirm that lining was painted on Kedleston Street this afternoon after the vehicle had parked and that a parking ticket was issued to the vehicle in error. 'It appears that there was a communication breakdown between our contractors undertaking the lining work and our enforcement officers. 'The ticket will be revoked and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.'   \n",

       "0  I recently had my swing analyzed at a local Dick's Sporting Goods. The sales rep told me that out of 6 swings I had two at 86 mph, one at 87 mph, two at 96 mph and one at 100 mph.  The first three were the lowest which he attributed to not being loose, which makes sense.  Also, I have a terrible slice off the tee that I would like to control. I am fairly new to the game and I am looking to get my own set of clubs as I am currently using my dad's. The trouble is, I don't know which shaft flex to get. The clubs I am leaning towards are Adams, which I have read typically are not as stiff as they are rated. But I want to make the right decision. Any advice?   \n",

       "      <td>If you're a photographer, keep all the necessary lens, cords, and batteries in the same quadrant of your home or studio. Paints should be kept with brushes, cleaner, and canvas, print supplies should be by the ink, etc. Make broader groups and areas for your supplies to make finding them easier, limiting your search to a much smaller area. Some ideas include:\\n\\n\\nEssential supplies area -- the things you use every day.\\nInspiration and reference area.\\nDedicated work area .\\nInfrequent or secondary supplies area, tucked out of the way.;\\n, This doesn't mean cleaning the entire studio, it just means keeping the area immediately around the desk, easel, pottery wheel, etc. clean each night. Discard trash or unnecessary materials and wipe down dirty surfaces. Endeavor to leave the workspace in a way that you can sit down the next day and start working immediately, without having to do any work or tidying.\\n\\n\\nEven if the rest of your studio is a bit disorganized, an organized workspace will help you get down to business every time you want to make art.\\n\\n, As visual people, a lot of artist clutter comes from a desire to keep track of supplies visually instead of tucked out of sight. By using jars, old glasses, vases, and cheap, clear plastic drawers, you can keep things in sight without leaving it strewn about haphazardly. Some ideas, beyond those just mentioned, include:\\n\\n\\nCanvas shoe racks on the back of the door\\nWine racks with cups in each slot to hold pens/pencils.\\nPlastic restaurant squirt bottles for paint, pigment, etc., Simply string up the wires across a wall or along the ceiling and use them to hold essential papers that you don't want to cut or ruin with tacks or tape. Cheap and easy, this is also a good way to handle papers and ideas you touch regularly or need to pin up and down for inspiration., Shelving is an artist's best friend and is a cheap and easy way to get more room in your studio or art space. Don't be afraid to get up high either, especially for infrequently used supplies. The upper reaches of the room are often the most under-utilized, but provide vital space for all your tools and materials., Turning one wall into a chalkboard gives you a perfect space for ideas, sketches, and planning without requiring extra equipment or space. You can even use it for smaller areas. Paint over jars or storage equipment, allowing you to relabel them with chalk as your needs change.\\n\\n, A lot of disorganization comes when you keep moving the location of things, trying to optimize your space by reorganizing frequently. This usually has the opposite effect, leading to lost items and uncertainty when cleaning, but an afternoon with a label maker can solve everything. Instead of spending all of your mental energy looking for or storing things, you can just follow the labels, freeing your mind to think about art., Once a month, do a purge of your studio. If it isn't essential or part of a project, either throw it out or file it away for later. Artists are constantly making new things, experimenting, and making a mess. This is a good thing, but only if you set aside time to declutter. It may not be fun at the moment, but it is a lot more fun than spending 30 minutes digging through junk to find the right paint or an old sketch.\\n\\n\\nDon't be sentimental here. If you haven't used it in the last six months there is little chance you'll use it in the next six months. Toss it.\\n\\n</td>\n",

You‘ll need equipment and effort, but planning and attention to detail will help you succeed. Painting a mural requires a suitable location, with the right surface that can be painted.\\n\\nThis surface should be smooth and flat. However, even rough-textured surfaces can be used for your NeoPopRealist mural project.\\n\\n, For exterior projects that last for years, using a newer 100% acrylic exterior paint would be your best choice. For interior walls, use latex paints. Latex offer easier cleanup and lower costs. By measuring the total wall area to be covered, the total amount of paint can be calculated, but since this mural painting requires two colors - white and black - figuring the actual area to be painted each color is necessary to allow purchasing the right amount of each one.\\n\\nLarge walls backgrounds may be rolled or sprayed with a white paint sprayer, where details may be added with brushes.\\nPaints are sensitive to high temperatures, humidity, direct sunlight, however, the interior projects do not have many complications. In public places, keeping the mural protected may require attention. For that reason, if you make your NeoPopRealist mural dedicated to its 25-year anniversary in school or office, you can consider using varnish for your mural.\\n\\n, See sample above. The design will give you a sense of proportion. You will have unique requirements and elements., Use a sketch and measure at scale the distances and locations of various points of your subject. Measuring key features will help you calculate the amount of paint when each feature is identified by its color., If the surface is low, the whole mural can be painted standing on the ground or from a stepladder. For higher work, you may have to rent a scaffold., Mark the horizontal and vertical lines., Use white paint as background., Then begin marking, using your scaled sketch, the location of key elements of objects, located in the foreground. Everything depends on the complexity of your mural. If you are confident in your artistic results, you may choose to draw all of the details in freehand., Be careful, keep clean transition edges from one color (black) to another (white). However, mistakes can be touched up later. Always allow fresh color to dry before proceeding to the drawing., An example would be painting a large patterns use big brushes, limbs, use small brushes for tiny and detailed patterns., If you have a drip or run, paint over it with the color paint appropriate for that location. Sharpen lines and patterns if they are blurred., If it is intended to last a long time or if it is on a surface that require cleaning, overcoat your mural project with a clear sealer., However, if you won't be able to involve more than 16 percent of your brain's grays matter, you'll end up with the primitive crafting of patterns or even worse, with doodling or so-called zen-doodling. But to create the NeoPopRealist ART one needs the abilities, which can be developed in talented people by studying using Nadia Russ' Neopoprealist instructional books. Other, the copycats' self-promotional superficial books will teach you only how to doodle because they have nothing in common with visual arts and its mission.\\n\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>It is possible to become a VFX artist without a college degree, but the path is often easier with one. VFX artists usually major in fine arts, computer graphics, or animation. Choose a college with a reputation for strength in these areas and a reputation for good job placement for graduates. The availability of internships is another factor to consider.Out of the jobs advertised for VFX artists, a majority at any given time specify a bachelor’s degree as a minimum requirement for applicants.;\\n, Some studios offer short-term programs for people who want to learn more about VFX artistry without pursuing a college degree. Enrolling in these programs can be expensive as financial aid isn’t always offered, but they usually have the most cutting edge technology for you to learn from., Although you may create some hand sketches, the majority of your work will be completed on the computer using the most up-to-date programs. Stay informed about the newest software advances by following VFX blogs and taking online computer tutorials.For example, VFX artists are expected to be well-versed in graphics and animation programs, such as Adobe Creative Suite and JavaScript.Clearly list every program that you can work with on your resume.\\n\\n, Hop onto YouTube or another video service and search for VFX clip reels or demonstrations. Some of these videos will focus on a particular skill set, such as shading, which you then can practice on your own. Challenge yourself to mimic some of the more difficult tasks, or even try to improve upon the models used., Take as many art and design classes as you can. Or, simply carry a sketch pad around with you to work on your basic animation skills. As you draw, consider factors such as lighting and framing. Even geometry skills can come in handy when creating a particular type of background or even a person’s face.Make a choice to become an observer of the world around you. Ask yourself: how could I capture the movement of the leaves? Or, in what situations do shadows appear?\\n\\n, Watch all of these creations with an eye for detail. Look for the techniques used and any original approaches that you see. Try to recreate any scenes that you find particularly interesting. Research the artists and see what their backgrounds are and contact them if you like., As you gain more experience, you’ll likely find yourself gravitating toward a certain aspect of design. This will become your “calling card” and directors and other professionals will seek you out for this type of work. To build your specialization, start choosing jobs with that emphasis and attend additional training seminars.For example, some VFX specialists focus on human character’s faces, animal figures, or city backgrounds.\\n\\n</td>\n",

Paints should be kept with brushes, cleaner, and canvas, print supplies should be by the ink, etc. Make broader groups and areas for your supplies to make finding them easier, limiting your search to a much smaller area. Some ideas include:\\n\\n\\nEssential supplies area -- the things you use every day.\\nInspiration and reference area.\\nDedicated work area .\\nInfrequent or secondary supplies area, tucked out of the way.;\\n, This doesn't mean cleaning the entire studio, it just means keeping the area immediately around the desk, easel, pottery wheel, etc. clean each night. Discard trash or unnecessary materials and wipe down dirty surfaces. Endeavor to leave the workspace in a way that you can sit down the next day and start working immediately, without having to do any work or tidying.\\n\\n\\nEven if the rest of your studio is a bit disorganized, an organized workspace will help you get down to business every time you want to make art.\\n\\n, As visual people, a lot of artist clutter comes from a desire to keep track of supplies visually instead of tucked out of sight. By using jars, old glasses, vases, and cheap, clear plastic drawers, you can keep things in sight without leaving it strewn about haphazardly. Some ideas, beyond those just mentioned, include:\\n\\n\\nCanvas shoe racks on the back of the door\\nWine racks with cups in each slot to hold pens/pencils.\\nPlastic restaurant squirt bottles for paint, pigment, etc., Simply string up the wires across a wall or along the ceiling and use them to hold essential papers that you don't want to cut or ruin with tacks or tape. Cheap and easy, this is also a good way to handle papers and ideas you touch regularly or need to pin up and down for inspiration., Shelving is an artist's best friend and is a cheap and easy way to get more room in your studio or art space. Don't be afraid to get up high either, especially for infrequently used supplies. The upper reaches of the room are often the most under-utilized, but provide vital space for all your tools and materials., Turning one wall into a chalkboard gives you a perfect space for ideas, sketches, and planning without requiring extra equipment or space. You can even use it for smaller areas. Paint over jars or storage equipment, allowing you to relabel them with chalk as your needs change.\\n\\n, A lot of disorganization comes when you keep moving the location of things, trying to optimize your space by reorganizing frequently. This usually has the opposite effect, leading to lost items and uncertainty when cleaning, but an afternoon with a label maker can solve everything. Instead of spending all of your mental energy looking for or storing things, you can just follow the labels, freeing your mind to think about art., Once a month, do a purge of your studio. If it isn't essential or part of a project, either throw it out or file it away for later. Artists are constantly making new things, experimenting, and making a mess. This is a good thing, but only if you set aside time to declutter. It may not be fun at the moment, but it is a lot more fun than spending 30 minutes digging through junk to find the right paint or an old sketch.\\n\\n\\nDon't be sentimental here. If you haven't used it in the last six months there is little chance you'll use it in the next six months. Toss it.\\n\\n  \n",
       "1   See the image for how this drawing develops step-by-step. However, there is an important detail: the following drawings are to examine it, and then, to create something unique.\\n\\n\\nUse the lines to create the image shape and sections.\\nFill appeared sections with different patterns/ ornaments.\\nAdd text if needed, for example \"NeoPopRealism is 25!\"\\nAdd a colored strip on the top, any color you wish.;\\n, Painting a mural always requires some preparation. You‘ll need equipment and effort, but planning and attention to detail will help you succeed. Painting a mural requires a suitable location, with the right surface that can be painted.\\n\\nThis surface should be smooth and flat. However, even rough-textured surfaces can be used for your NeoPopRealist mural project.\\n\\n, For exterior projects that last for years, using a newer 100% acrylic exterior paint would be your best choice. For interior walls, use latex paints. Latex offer easier cleanup and lower costs. By measuring the total wall area to be covered, the total amount of paint can be calculated, but since this mural painting requires two colors - white and black - figuring the actual area to be painted each color is necessary to allow purchasing the right amount of each one.\\n\\nLarge walls backgrounds may be rolled or sprayed with a white paint sprayer, where details may be added with brushes.\\nPaints are sensitive to high temperatures, humidity, direct sunlight, however, the interior projects do not have many complications. In public places, keeping the mural protected may require attention. For that reason, if you make your NeoPopRealist mural dedicated to its 25-year anniversary in school or office, you can consider using varnish for your mural.\\n\\n, See sample above. The design will give you a sense of proportion. You will have unique requirements and elements., Use a sketch and measure at scale the distances and locations of various points of your subject. Measuring key features will help you calculate the amount of paint when each feature is identified by its color., If the surface is low, the whole mural can be painted standing on the ground or from a stepladder. For higher work, you may have to rent a scaffold., Mark the horizontal and vertical lines., Use white paint as background., Then begin marking, using your scaled sketch, the location of key elements of objects, located in the foreground. Everything depends on the complexity of your mural. If you are confident in your artistic results, you may choose to draw all of the details in freehand., Be careful, keep clean transition edges from one color (black) to another (white). However, mistakes can be touched up later. Always allow fresh color to dry before proceeding to the drawing., An example would be painting a large patterns use big brushes, limbs, use small brushes for tiny and detailed patterns., If you have a drip or run, paint over it with the color paint appropriate for that location. Sharpen lines and patterns if they are blurred., If it is intended to last a long time or if it is on a surface that require cleaning, overcoat your mural project with a clear sealer., However, if you won't be able to involve more than 16 percent of your brain's grays matter, you'll end up with the primitive crafting of patterns or even worse, with doodling or so-called zen-doodling. But to create the NeoPopRealist ART one needs the abilities, which can be developed in talented people by studying using Nadia Russ' Neopoprealist instructional books. Other, the copycats' self-promotional superficial books will teach you only how to doodle because they have nothing in common with visual arts and its mission.\\n\\n  \n",

VFX artists usually major in fine arts, computer graphics, or animation. Choose a college with a reputation for strength in these areas and a reputation for good job placement for graduates. The availability of internships is another factor to consider.Out of the jobs advertised for VFX artists, a majority at any given time specify a bachelor’s degree as a minimum requirement for applicants.;\\n, Some studios offer short-term programs for people who want to learn more about VFX artistry without pursuing a college degree. Enrolling in these programs can be expensive as financial aid isn’t always offered, but they usually have the most cutting edge technology for you to learn from., Although you may create some hand sketches, the majority of your work will be completed on the computer using the most up-to-date programs. Stay informed about the newest software advances by following VFX blogs and taking online computer tutorials.For example, VFX artists are expected to be well-versed in graphics and animation programs, such as Adobe Creative Suite and JavaScript.Clearly list every program that you can work with on your resume.\\n\\n, Hop onto YouTube or another video service and search for VFX clip reels or demonstrations. Some of these videos will focus on a particular skill set, such as shading, which you then can practice on your own. Challenge yourself to mimic some of the more difficult tasks, or even try to improve upon the models used., Take as many art and design classes as you can. Or, simply carry a sketch pad around with you to work on your basic animation skills. As you draw, consider factors such as lighting and framing. Even geometry skills can come in handy when creating a particular type of background or even a person’s face.Make a choice to become an observer of the world around you. Ask yourself: how could I capture the movement of the leaves? Or, in what situations do shadows appear?\\n\\n, Watch all of these creations with an eye for detail. Look for the techniques used and any original approaches that you see. Try to recreate any scenes that you find particularly interesting. Research the artists and see what their backgrounds are and contact them if you like., As you gain more experience, you’ll likely find yourself gravitating toward a certain aspect of design. This will become your “calling card” and directors and other professionals will seek you out for this type of work. To build your specialization, start choosing jobs with that emphasis and attend additional training seminars.For example, some VFX specialists focus on human character’s faces, animal figures, or city backgrounds.\\n\\n  "
